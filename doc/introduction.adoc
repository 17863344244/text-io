Text-IO is a library for creating Java console applications.
It can be used in applications that need to read interactive input from the user.

*Features*

- supports reading values with various data types.
- allows masking the input when reading sensitive data.
- allows selecting a value from a list.
- allows to specify constraints on the input values (format patterns, value ranges, length constraints etc.).
- provides different terminal implementations and offers a Service Provider Interface (SPI) for configuring additional text terminals.

By default, Text-IO tries to use text terminals backed by http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Console.html[java.io.Console].
If no console device is present (which may happen, for example, when running the application in your IDE),
a Swing-based terminal is used instead.

*Example*

[source, java]
----
TextIO textIO = TextIoFactory.getTextIO();

String user = textIO.newStringInputReader()
        .withDefaultValue("admin")
        .read("Username");

String password = textIO.newStringInputReader()
        .withMinLength(6)
        .withInputMasking(true)
        .read("Password");

int age = textIO.newIntInputReader()
        .withMinVal(13)
        .read("Age");

Month month = textIO.newEnumInputReader(Month.class)
        .read("What month were you born in?");

TextTerminal terminal = textIO.getTextTerminal();
terminal.printf("\nUser %s is %d years old, was born in %s and has the password %s.\n",
        user, age, month, password);

You can also use a web-based terminal, which allows you to access your application via a browser, as shown in the image below.

== Demo

Download the https://github.com/beryx/{project-name}/releases/download/v{project-version}/textio-demo-{project-version}.zip[binary distribution] and unzip it into a directory of your choice.

Make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable correctly points to a JDK 8u40 or later.

Start the demo by executing 'textio-demo' or 'textio-demo.bat' in the bin directory.

Change the configuration by editing the properties files and see how your changes affect the behavior and the visual appearance of the application.

TIP: Have a look at the list of
https://github.com/beryx/text-io/wiki/Demos,-Examples-and-Projects-using-Text-IO[demos, examples and projects] that use Text-IO.
